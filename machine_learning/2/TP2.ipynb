    "1. Generate an artificial dataset using a linear function with known parameters and some added noise.\n",

    "    - 1.1. Study the effect of the number of examples $N$ (from 2 to 200) and of noise dispersion on the coefficient estimates.\n",

    "      - Are the estimates of the coefficients stable?\n",

    "    - 1.2 Study the effect of $N$ on $R^2$ (R square).\n",

    "2. Generate datasets of 50 points with some relatively small noise where the true function is non-linear $y=\\alpha x^2 +3$. Study how R2 changes with $\\alpha$ taking 10 different values from $0.1$ to $10$. What do you conclude? \n",
